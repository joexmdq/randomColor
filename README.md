# randomColor
Random HEX, RGB, HSL color generator

I'm learning JavaScript, and this is the best way I UNDERSTAND enough to make the random number generator.
I know there are better ways to do it, but I just wanted a simple (and own) way to make random colors and be able
to link it to any document I create!
